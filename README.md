# PRODIGY_INFOTECH_internship-tasks
The following tasks represent the curriculum for my internship. I will be implementing these sequentially to build a foundation in cryptography, software security, and network analysis.

**Task 01: _Implement Caesar Cipher_**\
Develop a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users will be able to input a custom message and a shift value for processing.

**Task 02: _Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption_**\
Create a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. The goal is to perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying mathematical operations to scramble and unscramble visual data.

**Task 03: _Password Complexity Checker_**\
Build a tool to assess password strength based on criteria like length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It will provide users with immediate feedback on how secure their password is.

**Task 04: _Simple Keylogger_**\
Develop a basic program to record and log keystrokes to a local file. This task focuses on understanding how input data is handled and emphasizes the ethical considerations and permissions required for such projects.

**Task 05: _Network Packet Analyzer_**\
Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. The program will display relevant information such as source/destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data for educational purposes
